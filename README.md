# Spider's curse

# first work of Haram Choi
# chapter 1
I once thought that if I eat my fear I will not fear it for I  have eaten it but I was wrong.One night I saw a taranrula my grearest fear I didn't know what to do so I ate it just like i thought.
as the spider crawled creeping I picked the monstorous thing it flailed and wriggled as I picked it up it was a disgusting feeling, as I raised it higher and higher it looked at me with its eight eyes I put the monstorous thing in my mouth as i clampped my mouth shut I felt its two front legs fall off as i chewed i felt it. I felt wriggle and die, I felt its hairy body with my tounge.It was a disgusting sensation.then i swallowed it, as its hairy and disembodied body went down my throat I looked in the mirror seeing my reflection.its my reflection right ,right? i saw its eight eyes looking back at me or are they my eyes? I didn'nt know what I was looking at 
I just cant make out what im looking at i just cant look at it any longer.I looked away thinking about what I just saw in the mirror...
# part 2
I'm thinking and thinking what did i just see?I saw a monster was that me?did eating my fear make me into this monster what am I?
I could'nt takethis mental damage.I got beer from my fridge I kept on drinking I kept on drinking and drinking until I passed out the next morning i looked into the mirror and i saw my normal reflection.I assumed what I saw yesterday was just a dream.I just cant help thinking myself becoming my fear after consuming my fear.....
I suddenly felt a crawling sensaton on my arm it felt like a....SPIDER I freaked out thinking if there was a spider on my arm but it was nothing there was nothing but then I suddenly felt crawling sensation all over me.
# chapter 3
 I woke up with a jolting start.I felt the spiders all over my bodies.I screamed as I screamed 5 spiders went into my mouth out of reflects I clampped my mouth shut killing all 5 soiders at once I stood up I went into the bathroom pouring water on me getting the spiders off me then I saw it my eight eyes.Then the image changed it was a giant spider "I am the God of spider Arhkam"The Giant spider said "I will turn you into a normal human if u accept the spiders curse.but if u dont want to accept the spiders curse you will keep those eight eyes.Remember this happend because you ate my kin" Arhkam said " what you experienced a while ago was the spiders curse. " i thought cold blood rushing through my veins i thought fast what should I pick then I said "I dont want these hidious eyes i dont care about the curse I just dont want these hidous eyes." "very well as you wish." Arhkam said.
