# Spider's curse

# first work of Haram Choi
# chapter 1
I once thought that if I eat my fear I will not fear it for I  have eaten it but I was wrong.One night I saw a taranrula, my grearest fear I didn't know what to do so I ate it.
as the spider crawled creeping I picked the monstorous thing as it flailed and wriggled as I picked it up it was a disgusting feeling, as I raised it higher and higher it looked at me with its eight eyes I put the monstorous thing in my mouth as I clampped my mouth shut I felt its two front legs fall off as I chewed. I felt its body wriggle and die, I felt its hairy body with my tounge.It was a disgusting sensation.then I swallowed it, as its hairy and disembodied body went down my throat I looked in the mirror seeing my reflection.its my reflection right ,right? i saw its eight eyes looking back at me or are they my eyes? I didn'nt know what I was looking at 
I just cant make out what im looking at i just cant look at it any longer.I looked away thinking about what I just saw in the mirror...
# part 2
I'm thinking and thinking what did i just see?I saw a monster was that me?did eating my fear make me into this monster what am I?
I could'nt takethis mental damage.I got beer from my fridge I kept on drinking I kept on drinking and drinking until I passed out the next morning i looked into the mirror and i saw my normal reflection.I assumed what I saw yesterday was just a dream.I just cant help thinking myself becoming my fear after consuming my fear.....
I suddenly felt a crawling sensaton on my arm it felt like a....SPIDER I freaked out thinking if there was a spider on my arm but it was nothing there was nothing but then I suddenly felt crawling sensation all over me.
# chapter 3
 I woke up with a jolting start.I felt the spiders all over my bodies.I screamed as I screamed 5 spiders went into my mouth out of reflects I clampped my mouth shut killing all 5 soiders at once I stood up I went into the bathroom pouring water on me getting the spiders off me then I saw it my eight eyes.Then the image changed it was a giant spider "I am the God of spider Arhkam"The Giant spider said "I will turn you into a normal human if u accept the spiders curse.but if u dont want to accept the spiders curse you will keep those eight eyes.Remember this happend because you ate my kin" Arhkam said " what you experienced a while ago was the spiders curse. " i thought cold blood rushing through my veins i thought fast what should I pick then I said "I dont want these hidious eyes i dont care about the curse I just dont want these hidous eyes." "very well as you wish." Arhkam said.
 # chapter 4 
So this is me 26 year old with the "spider's curse" tch I hate this curse but I got used to the spiders and also the spiders are a great alarm clock.Now you might go like "Hey wheres the fun part?" now now the fun part starts when i meet this super weird monk..."Hello child" said the Monk. "I'm not a kid baldy" I said the monk shot me a nasty glare "I sense a great curse on you." "whatever and also who the hell are you?"i said "I am John.John Doberman." said the monk "how do you even know that I have a great curse?" I said "Because Im an exorcist idiot." said the monk he spat the "idiot" "oh ho John that was a good comeback" I said "I can teach you how to turn your curse into your power" the monk said "really?how?how do i do i change my curse inot a power?"I said "I can teach you but you have to come to the temple with me" he said as he raised an eyebrow "Meh.whatever I'll tag along."I said If im being honest. this monk had a hippie van.I was cringing at that hidous thing like Ugh my eyes are melting from the bright color."This baby here gets weird looks from people but shes still good."john said "you dont say."i said sarcasticly.to be honest with you guys this monk had a hippie personality if Im being honest.we got on the van as I asked a question"So what do exorcists do?" I asked. "We kill demons and fend off evil gods" The monk said simply."cool so are spider gods bad?" i asked again "Yes espically spider gods Arhkam is the worst of them all." "oh well guess what john spider god dude is the guy who put a curse on me." i said "WAIT WHAT?!?!?!"the monk asked(while screaming)
